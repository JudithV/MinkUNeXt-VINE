# MinkUNeXt-VINE

This repository contains the code of the MinkUNeXt-VINE convolutional neural network. This method is a compressed version of the [MinkUNeXt](https://github.com/juanjo-cabrera/MinkUNeXt) model, which was enhanced with Matryoshka Representation Learning to improve the results with low-cost sparse LiDAR sensors and low-resolution inputs.
